# Database Numeric Overflow Issue - Fixed

## Problem Identified
PostgreSQL is rejecting opportunities with error: **"numeric field overflow"**
- Error: `A field with precision 20, scale 8 must round to an absolute value less than 10^12`
- Database schema: `DECIMAL(20,8)` fields (buy_price, sell_price, profit_amount, volume, volume_24h)
- Maximum allowed value: 999,999,999,999.99999999 (must be < 10^12)

## Root Cause
Some opportunities have very large numeric values (especially volumes or profit amounts) that exceed the `DECIMAL(20,8)` limit, causing the entire batch insert to fail.

**Evidence from logs:**
- Scanner found 31 valid opportunities ✅
- All opportunities failing to save due to overflow ❌
- Result: Database stays empty → UI shows nothing ❌

## Solution Implemented
Added value clamping in `PostgresArbitrageOpportunityModel.sanitizeOpportunity()`:
- Clamps all `DECIMAL(20,8)` fields to max 999,999,999,999.99999999
- Validates and sanitizes before database insert
- Logs warnings when values are clamped

## Files Modified
- `src/database/models/PostgresArbitrageOpportunityModel.ts` - Added clamping logic

## Impact
- Opportunities will now be saved to database successfully
- Large values will be clamped but opportunities won't be lost
 irregularities- UI will display opportunities once they're stored

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Ready for deployment
